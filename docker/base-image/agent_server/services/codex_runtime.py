"""OpenAI Codex CLI execution service (#1187).

Implements the :class:`AgentRuntime` interface for OpenAI's Codex CLI, the third
Trinity agent runtime alongside Claude Code and Gemini.

Built **independently** on the existing per-runtime primitives (process
registry, concurrency-safe orphan drain, activity tracking, credential
sanitizer) rather than on a shared subprocess helper — see #1187 decision 4.
That keeps Codex from inheriting Gemini's blanket ``kill_cgroup_orphans()``
(which SIGKILLs sibling executions in the same cgroup); Codex uses the
concurrency-safe ``_drain_bounded`` path that preserves other in-flight work.

Safety parity with the Claude path (#1187 decision 8, Phase C):
  * **System prompt / identity** — the backend's effective ``system_prompt``
    is prepended to every turn (Codex ``exec`` has no ``--append-system-prompt``);
    persistent identity comes from ``AGENTS.md`` (startup copies ``CLAUDE.md``).
  * **Read-only mode** — when ``~/.trinity/read-only-config.json`` is enabled,
    Codex runs with ``--sandbox read-only`` (the Claude hook can't apply here).
  * **Guardrails** — read-only is honored via the sandbox; ``disallowed_tools``
    that have no Codex equivalent are SURFACED in the logs, never silently
    dropped.
  * **Credential sanitization** — every stdout line, the final response, and
    stderr pass through ``utils.credential_sanitizer`` exactly as the Claude /
    headless paths do.

Codex specifics:
  * Non-interactive: ``codex exec [PROMPT]``; ``--json`` emits a JSONL event
    stream; ``-o/--output-last-message FILE`` is the durable result record
    (#548/#333) — read-then-delete in ``finally``.
  * Continuity: ``codex exec resume <thread_id>`` replays a prior thread.
  * No native cost — derived from ``turn.completed.usage`` token counts.

# Codex reports NO cost of its own (``cost_reporting: "estimated"``), so the
# number computed here IS the number Trinity records — it feeds
# ``schedule_executions.cost``, agent analytics, cost-threshold alerts, and the
# loop cost budget ``max_cost_usd`` (#1155). A budget is a SPEND CONTROL, so an
# understated rate is not a cosmetic metric error: it is a control bypass. Rates
# are therefore chosen to fail toward OVER-reporting, mirroring the safe-failure
# direction the context catalog argues for in ``model_context.py``.
#
# Rates are USD **per 1,000,000 tokens**, stated exactly as OpenAI publishes
# them, so this table can be diffed against the rate card by eye. (#2207 changed
# the unit from per-1K: the defect being fixed was a stale transcription, and
# per-1K forced mental arithmetic on every audit.)

# CACHE WRITES ARE PRICED, because Codex does report them. A real gpt-5.6-sol
# turn on codex-cli 0.147.0 emits:
#     "usage": {"input_tokens": 11398, "cached_input_tokens": 0,
#               "cache_write_input_tokens": 11395, "output_tokens": 6, ...}
# i.e. ``cache_write_input_tokens`` is a SUBSET of ``input_tokens`` — the same
# subset trap as ``reasoning_output_tokens`` ⊂ ``output_tokens``. Input therefore
# decomposes three ways and each part bills at its own rate:
#     plain = input_tokens - cached_input_tokens - cache_write_input_tokens
# Writes carry a 1.25x surcharge on gpt-5.4+; on that measured turn 99.97% of the
# input were writes, so ignoring them under-reports the input side by ~25%.
#
# STILL out of scope: fast mode (~2x) is genuinely unobservable — nothing in the
# event stream distinguishes it. That omission understates cost, is bounded, and
# is documented rather than guessed.
#
# ``gpt-5.3-codex`` is deliberately absent: it is still reachable with an API key
# but OpenAI publishes no rate for it, so it resolves to ``default`` (which
# over-reports) rather than carrying a number we cannot source. Same for
# ``gpt-5.3-codex-spark``. NEVER add a rate that is not on the card.

    #   2. An id we have never seen is more likely a NEWER (pricier) model than
    #      an older one. Guessing cheap silently under-bills; guessing flagship
    #      over-bills a budget into stopping early. Only one of those is safe.

    #1971: subscription auth lives in ``$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`` and is the whole

    design. Trinity modelled only the API-key path, so `_execute_codex` refused
    to start at all without one, and the reporter's working setup needed a
    *placeholder* ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` to get past the gate. A placeholder that
    exists solely to satisfy a check is the check being wrong.

    #2208 narrows it from existence to **mode**. That is not the token
    validation #1971 declined to do (still the CLI's job) — it is classifying
    who wrote the file. Trinity now writes an ``auth_mode: apikey`` auth.json
    itself, so an existence test would report every API-key agent as a
    subscription agent, and the gate below would then let a container whose key
    was REMOVED from ``.env`` keep running on the stale file it left behind —
    silent failure of credential revocation, the #1999 class.

    An auth.json with no ``auth_mode`` (older CLI) — or one we cannot parse —
    still counts as a subscription credential: unknown provenance is not ours to
    discount, and over-reporting here preserves the pre-#2208 behaviour exactly.
    That matters for the unreadable case specifically, because #1971's whole

      positively identify as our own.
    * **Key rotation propagates** — a stored key that no longer matches the

      per turn (process env first, then ``/home/developer/.env``), so an edited

      baked into the container env still wins over ``.env`` — rotation via
      ``.env`` only reaches agents that do not carry one.
    * **Never raises** — a login failure is logged at ERROR and the turn
