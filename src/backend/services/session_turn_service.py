"""Resumable-turn core — the `--resume` engine, shared by both continuous
conversation surfaces.

Every primitive here was previously private to ``routers/sessions.py``. It moved
out for abilityai/trinity-enterprise#358: the Workspace absorbs the Session
surface, and it can only do that without a continuity downgrade if it runs the
*same* engine — cached Claude UUID → per-``(agent, uuid)`` resume lock →
``execute_task(persist_session=True, resume_session_id=…)`` → one cold retry when
the JSONL is gone. Two copies of that dance would drift, and the failure mode of
drift is silent: a turn that quietly forgets.

So the engine lives here (Invariant #1 — the router held business logic), and the
two callers own only their own persistence:

* ``routers/sessions.py`` → ``agent_sessions`` (per platform user)
* ``client_portal/service.py`` → ``enterprise_portal_sessions`` (per client email)

``routers/sessions.py`` re-exports the moved names under their original private
aliases, so the legacy surface — and the tests pinning it — see no change.

# Two distinct Redis primitives gate a resumable turn:
#
# 1. `session_lock:{agent}:{uuid}` — per-(agent, claude_uuid) lock that
#    serialises concurrent `claude --resume <same-uuid>` calls (Anthropic
#    #20992: concurrent resume calls corrupt the JSONL). Cold turns take
#    `session_lock:cold:{session_key}` instead (#779) — there is no JSONL to
#    corrupt yet, but two concurrent first turns would otherwise race on the
#    cache write and orphan one.
#
# 2. `session_inflight:{session_key}` — per-session sentinel SET for the
#    duration of any turn (cold or warm). Drives `turn_in_progress` so a UI can
#    reattach on activation (#759). Distinct from the resume lock because the
#    lock's key shape changes between cold and warm turns.
#
# TTL for both is dynamic: at acquire time we look up the per-agent
# `execution_timeout_seconds` (default 3600) and add a 30s buffer, capped at
# 7230s. Stale-lock cleanup after a backend crash is bounded by this TTL
# (worst case ≈ 2h); admins can manually `DEL` if needed.

       a cold turn has no session memory to carry it.

    ``on_resume_failure`` fires before the retry so the caller can clear its
    cached UUID inside the same lock — a crash between the two leaves a stale
    id that simply re-fires this path on the next turn (self-healing).
